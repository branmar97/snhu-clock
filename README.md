# SNHU C++ Clock

A simple command line app created using C++ that takes user input and outputs time in 12-hour and 24-hour time formats. The user can add seconds, minutes, and hours to the clock.

- What did you do particularly well?
I thought I did best at maintaining the readability of my code with indentation and line spacing. I was easily able to review my code and make revisions quickly and easily.

- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
In a professional environment, Time and Menu would probably be handled by separate classes for maintainability and readability.

- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Initially I ran into type issues where my program was crashing because I was using **void main()** when my function was handling integer values. Simply changing this to **int main()** solved that problem. I enjoy how explicit C++ is with types.

- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
It is transferable to anything software related, no matter the language, but the most important security and data types. With C++ being strongly typed, everything is explicit which prevents errors and malicious activity.

- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used classes, comments, indentation, and spacing.
